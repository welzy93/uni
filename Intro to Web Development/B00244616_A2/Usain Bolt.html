Usain Bolt was born 21 August 1986 is a Jamaican sprinter widely regarded as the fastest person ever.
He is the first man to hold both the 100 metres and 200 metres world records since fully automatic time measurements became mandatory in 1977. 
Along with his teammates, he also set the world record in the 4×100 metres relay. 
He is the reigning Olympic champion in these three events, the first man to win six Olympic gold medals in sprinting, and a five-time World champion. 
He was the first to achieve a "double double" by winning 100 m and 200 m titles at consecutive Olympics (2008 and 2012) and topped this through the first "double triple" (including 4x100m relays).
<br>
His 2009 record breaking margin for 100 m, from 9.69 (his own previous world record) to 9.58, is the highest since the start of fully automatic time measurements.
<br>
His achievements in sprinting have earned him the media nickname "Lightning Bolt" and awards including the IAAF World Athlete of the Year, Track & Field Athlete of the Year, and Laureus Sportsman of the Year (twice). 
He is the highest paid athlete ever in track and field. He has been called the world’s most marketable athlete and the greatest athlete ever.
