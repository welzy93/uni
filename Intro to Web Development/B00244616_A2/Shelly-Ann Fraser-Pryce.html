<h2> Shell-Ann Fraser-Pryce </h2>
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce was born December 27, 1986, she is a Jamaican track and field sprinter. Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Fraser-Pryce ascended to prominence in the 2008 Olympic Games when at 21 years-old, 
the then unknown athlete became the first Caribbean woman to win 100 m gold at the Olympics. 
In 2012, she successfully defended her 100 m title, becoming the third woman—and first non-American—to win two consecutive 100 m events at the Olympics.
The 2009 World Champion over 100 m, Fraser-Pryce is also the second female sprinter to hold both World and Olympic 100 m titles simultaneously (after Gail Devers). 
Nicknamed the "pocket rocket" for her petite frame (she stands 5 feet tall) and explosive starts, she is ranked fourth on the list of the fastest 100 m female sprinters of all time, 
with a personal best of 10.70 seconds, set in Kingston, Jamaica in 2012.

Fellow Jamaican Veronica Campbell-Brown took bronze.
