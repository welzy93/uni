<h2>Allyson felix</h2>
Allyson Michelle Felix was born November 18, 1985 is a track and field sprint athlete, who competes internationally for the United States. 
Her specialty is the 200 meter race, winning the 2012 Olympic gold, two Olympic silver medals, and three world championship golds. 
She also competes at the 100 meter and the 400 meter distances, winning three Olympic gold medals as a member of the United States' women's relay teams, 
two at 4×400 meters and one as part of the world-record 4×100 meter team. Her three gold medals at the 2012 Summer Olympics are the most a female track athlete has won since 1988. 
As a participant in the US Anti-Doping Agency's "Project Believe" program, Felix is regularly tested to ensure that her body is free of performance-enhancing drugs.

<h2>2012 London Olympics</h2>
At the 2012 Summer Olympics Felix competed in 4 events: The 100m, 200m, 4x100m relay, and 4x400m relay, placing 5th in the 100m and winning gold in the other three, 
thus becoming the first American woman to win three golds in athletics at an Olympics since Florence Griffith-Joyner at the 1988 Summer Olympics. 
In her first final, the 100m, she placed 5th, running a personal best time of 10.89 seconds. In the 200m final; a race she lost at the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2004 Summer Olympics to Jamaican rival, 
Veronica Campbell-Brown, it proved third time lucky as she beat Campbell-Brown, and also the 2012 100m Olympic Gold medallist, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who finished second. American compatriot Carmelita Jeter took the bronze.
Felix took to the track again on August 10, 2012 as part of the women's 4x100m relay team with Tianna Madison, Bianca Knight, and Carmelita Jeter. 
The foursome went on to smash the long held world record of 41.37, set by East Germany in October 1985. This record was set before Allyson Felix, Bianca Knight, or Tianna Madison were even born.
On the final night of athletics August 11, 2012, Felix ran the 2nd leg of the women's 4 x 400m (in a leg time of 47.80), with DeeDee Trotter, 
Francena McCorory, and Sanya Richards-Ross, with the winning time being 3:16.87, the 3rd fastest time in Olympic history behind the Soviet Union and USA at the 1988 Summer Olympics, and the 5th fastest time overall.
