<h2>Design</h2>
<p>
The design of my website is clear and uncluttered and the layout is consistent from page to page. The pages are quick to download 
and i have avoided using one large graphic that may put some viewers off as first impressions are important
</p>

<h2>Usability</h2>
<p>
My website is easy to use for an end-user without the requirment for any specialized training to be undertaken
, the user of my site will be able to intuitively relate the actions needed to perform on the web page with 
other interactions for example pressing a button to perform a action.
The information is presented to the user in a clear an concise way and important items such as links are placed
in appropriate places because the purpose of a website is to get users to the information they want or need 
as quickly as possible
</p>

<h2>Colour</h2>
<p>
The colour of web site is one of the first things we see when we look at a web page, it can provoke strong physical reactions.
It can add another dimension to a web page, it will suggest their own meaning and can trigger different feeling towards the site.
Different colours can help with the orientaion and structure of the web site and facilitate access to information.
</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>
The site is reasonably easy to access, it doesn't take a long time to load
, there is an adequate text-to-backgroung contrast and the images have appropriate ALT tags
