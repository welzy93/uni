	<h2>About Me </h2>
	<p>
	I have had an interest in computers from a very early age, and thought that it would be very interesting, 
	challenging and fulfilling to pursue a career in Computing when I was older. Due to this interest it encouraged me to choose 
	Information Systems, Business Management and Administration courses through-out my time at Dumfries Academy Secondary School.  
	This mix of subjects gave me the chance to develop my computing skills and interests in a variety of ways.  
	Information Technology is very useful and important in the modern world of business and ICT, 
	and gave me the incentive and interest to learn more about these subjects during my time at Dumfries Academy. 
	Also finding out more about computers and the way they are needed, used and also very useful in our working day. 
	Enjoying computing comes very easy to me due the projects that I have been set to complete in the past, 
	finding them very interesting and fun but challenging at the same time giving me the chance to develop my problem solving skills. 
	</p>

	During my time at Secondary School I took part in a week’s Work Placement at Arnold Clark, this is an automotive dealership. 
	While I was there the staff encouraged and helped me to develop new skills such as Time Management and Team Working Skills.

	During the summer I was lucky enough to attend a Summer School Course in Computing at The University of The West of Scotland, 
	which enabled me to get a broader understanding of what a course In computing would entail and 
	throughout this course I learned how to do Computer Programming which was very interesting, 
	learning something new was also very challenging at the same time and required me to think through problems 
	and what was needed to do while trying to complete tasks.                                                                                               
	At the moment I have a part-time job at the local Morrisons Supermarket in Dumfries, 
	doing this has helped me to develop many important skills needed to do this job. 
	It is a very busy environment most of the time where I was needed to have organisational skills and to prioritise tasks 
	which are done under the watchful eye of Supervisors and Managers. It is essential to work as part of a team member 
	and also being able to work individually when needed.                                                                                                                                                           
	Overall I believe that a University Education is an excellent path into a world of ICT.
