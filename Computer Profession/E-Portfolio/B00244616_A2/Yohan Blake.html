Yohan Blake (born 26 December 1989 in St. James, Jamaica), is a Jamaican sprinter of the 100-metre and 200-metre dash races. 
He won a silver medal in the 2012 Olympic Games in London in the 100-m and 200-m races for the Jamaican team. He is known by the nickname, "The Beast."
Blake's 100 m personal best of 9.69 seconds makes him the equal second fastest man ever with Tyson Gay, and after Usain Bolt. 
His personal best for the 200 m (19.26 seconds) is the second fastest ever after Bolt. 
He holds the national junior record for the 100 metres, and is the youngest sprinter to have broken the 10-second barrier (at 19 years, 196 days). 
In 2009, along with three other sprinters he was suspended for three months after testing positive for a substance similar to a banned stimulant.
He is coached by Glen Mills. His training partners are Usain Bolt and Daniel Bailey.
