<h2>Carmelita Jeter</h2>
Carmelita Jeter was born November 24, 1979 she is an American sprinter who specializes in the 100 meters. She is the second fastest woman of all time and the current IAAF World Champion in the 100 metres.
She won the 100 m bronze at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics and a gold at the World Athletics Final. She won a second World Championship bronze. However, greater performances followed, 
winning her second gold of the World Athletics Final in 10.67 seconds and winning the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix in 10.64 seconds after that. This made her the second fastest woman ever in the 100 m, 
beating Marion Jones's best and bringing her closer to Florence Griffith-Joyner's long standing world record. Currently she holds three of the top ten times ever run.
On 23 June 2012 won the women's 100-meter title at the U.S. Olympic track and field trials, giving her the Olympic berth she missed out on for the 2008 Games in Beijing. Jeter won the race in 10.92 seconds.
<h2> 2012 London Olympics </h2>
At the 2012 Olympics, Carmelita won gold in the 4x100m relay, Silver in the 100m and Bronze in the 200m making her the first athlete to ever medal in both the 100m and 200m race at the Olympics.
Carmelita anchored the 2012 US Olympic 4x100m relay team that smashed the old record by more than a half of a second.
