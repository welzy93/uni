<p> 
The opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympic Games took place on the evening of Friday 27 July in the Olympic Stadium, London. 
As mandated by the Olympic Charter, the proceedings combined the formal and ceremonial opening of this international sporting event, 
including welcoming speeches, hoisting of the flags and the parade of athletes, with an artistic spectacle to showcase the host nation’s culture. 
For London 2012 the Games were formally opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. The spectacle was entitled Isles of Wonder 
and designed by film director Danny Boyle, with musical direction by electronic music group Underworld.
Prior to London 2012 there had been considerable apprehension about Britain’s ability to stage an opening ceremony that would reach the standard 
set by the Beijing Summer Games in 2008, where the ceremony had been noted for its scale, extravagance and expense, and been hailed as the "greatest ever". 
The Beijing ceremony had cost £65m whereas London spent an estimated £27m (out of £80m budgeted for its four ceremonies), which was nevertheless about twice the original budget. 
However, the 2012 ceremony was generally seen as a tremendous success, praised by numerous publications and spectators as a "masterpiece" and "a love letter to Britain".
The ceremony began at 21:00 BST and lasted almost four hours. It was watched by an estimated worldwide television audience of 900 million, becoming the most-viewed 
Olympic opening ceremony in both the US and UK. The content had largely been kept secret until the performance itself, despite involving thousands of volunteers and after two public rehearsals. 
The principal sections of the artistic display represented Britain's industrial revolution, National Health Service, and its musical and literary heritage, 
and were noted for their vibrant storytelling and use of music. 
Two shorter sections drew particular comment, involving a filmed cameo appearance of the Queen, and a live performance by the London Symphony Orchestra joined by Rowan Atkinson. 
These were widely ascribed to Britain's sense of humour. The ceremony featured children and young people in most of its segments, reflecting the 'inspire a generation' aspiration of London's original bid for the Games.
