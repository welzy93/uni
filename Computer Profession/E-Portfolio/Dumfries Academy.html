	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
	Dumfries Academy has existed in its present form, though not in the buildings it currently occupies, 
	since 1804. Its history dates back to the 14th century, making it the earliest school in the Dumfries area.
	<br><br>Early records show that John of Greyfriars, a monk, 
	was appointed rector of a new school in Dumfries in 1330. Being a church school it 
	concentrated on the study of religious texts, but in the centuries which followed other schools 
	built in the town which taught subjects such as brewing, mathematics, English, baking, 
	and needlework became integrated into the Academy building.
	<br><br>The Academy operated as a grammar school for those in Dumfries 
	deemed academically gifted as based on exam results until July 1983. 
	The most gifted students from three surrounding secondary schools transferred to the 
	Academy after second year. As a result, Dumfries Academy had the highest rate 
	of university entrance of any state school for many years.
	<br><br>The Academy has been a six-year comprehensive school since July 1985 serving part of the Burgh of Dumfries 
	and surrounding rural communities, with an average roll of over 700 pupils and around 50 teaching staff. 
	Students are placed into one of three houses in their first year; Criffel, Nithsdale, and Solway.
