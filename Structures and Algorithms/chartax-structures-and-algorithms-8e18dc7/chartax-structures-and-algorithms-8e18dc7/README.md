Structures & Algorithms Labs
=========================

This repository holds all of my solutions to the Structures & Algorithm lab exercises. I use this as a working repo, meaning that the code held within may not be completed, work correctly or even compile.

Please feel free to use the code in this repository as a point-of-reference or as an idea of how I did something. There is always more than one solution and mine is almost always not the best. I'd also request that you please do not simply copy and paste the code in this repository into your own code.
